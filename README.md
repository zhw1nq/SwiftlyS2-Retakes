2. Install the **[Cookies](https://github.com/SwiftlyS2-Plugins/Cookies)** plugin.
3. Copy the published plugin folder to your server:
   ```
   .../game/csgo/addons/swiftlys2/plugins/Retakes/
   ```
4. Ensure the `resources/` folder is alongside the DLL (maps, translations, gamedata).
5. Start or restart the server.

## Player Preferences

The plugin saves player preferences using the [Cookies](https://github.com/SwiftlyS2-Plugins/Cookies) plugin. All preferences persist between sessions and are loaded automatically on connect.

### What Gets Saved

| Category | Preferences |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Weapons** | AWP toggle, SSG08 toggle (full-buy), SSG08 half-buy toggle, AWP priority, pistol round primary, half-buy primary/secondary, full-buy primary/secondary |
| **Spawns** | Spawn menu toggle, T/CT preferred spawn per bombsite (A and B) |

### Configuration

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Preferences.UsePerTeamPreferences` | `true` | Separate T/CT weapon preferences in `!guns` |
| `Preferences.SpawnMenuEnabled` | `true` | Enable the CT spawn selection menu (`!spawns` and the toggle in `!retake`). When `false`, the feature is hidden everywhere and CTs are always auto-assigned spawns regardless of any saved preference |
| `Preferences.DatabaseConnectionName` | `"default"` | Cookies database connection name |

---

## Weapon Allocation

### Round Types

| Round Type | Armor | Primary | Secondary | CT Defuser |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pistol** | Kevlar only (no helmet by default) | Pistol | ❌ | 1 random CT player |
| **Half-Buy** | Kevlar + Helmet | SMGs / budget rifles (or Scout) | ✅ Pistol | All CTs |
| **Full-Buy** | Kevlar + Helmet | Rifles (or AWP / Scout) | ✅ Pistol | All CTs |

### Round Type Selection

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Allocation.Enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable weapon allocation entirely |
| `Allocation.RoundType` | `"random"` | How each round's type is chosen (see modes below) |

  "RoundType": "sequence",
  "RoundTypeSequence": [
    { "Type": "Pistol",  "Count": 3  },
    { "Type": "HalfBuy", "Count": 2  },
    { "Type": "FullBuy", "Count": 25 }

</details>

### Weapon Selection

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Allocation.PistolHelmet` | `false` | Give helmet on pistol rounds (otherwise kevlar only) |
| `Allocation.InstantSwap` | `true` | Swap weapons in-hand immediately when a player changes preference mid-round |

Weapon selection priority (human players):
1. Player's saved preference (from `!guns`)
2. Configured default loadout (`Weapons.Defaults.*`)
3. Random weapon from the allowed list

Bots always receive a random weapon from the allowed list.

### Allowed Weapon Lists

Configured under `Weapons`:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Weapons.BuyMenuEnabled` | Show/hide the buy menu (disabling also zeroes player money) |
| `Weapons.Pistols` | List of weapons selectable on pistol rounds and as secondaries |
| `Weapons.HalfBuy.T` / `.Ct` / `.All` | Allowed primaries for half-buy rounds per team |
| `Weapons.FullBuy.T` / `.Ct` / `.All` | Allowed primaries for full-buy rounds per team |

### Default Loadouts

Used when a player has no saved preference yet. Player selections always override these.

```json
"Weapons": {
  "Defaults": {
    "Pistol": {
      "Primary": { "T": "weapon_glock", "Ct": "weapon_usp_silencer" },
      "Secondary": { "T": null, "Ct": null }
    },
    "HalfBuy": {
      "Primary": { "T": "weapon_galilar", "Ct": "weapon_famas" },
      "Secondary": { "T": "weapon_glock", "Ct": "weapon_usp_silencer" }
    },
    "FullBuy": {
      "Primary": { "T": "weapon_ak47", "Ct": "weapon_m4a1_silencer" },
      "Secondary": { "T": "weapon_glock", "Ct": "weapon_usp_silencer" }
    }
  }
}
```

### AWP Allocation

Only on full-buy rounds. Players must toggle `!awp` to be eligible.

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Allocation.AwpEnabled` | `true` | Enable AWP allocation |
| `Allocation.AwpPerTeam` | `1` | Maximum AWPs given per team |
| `Allocation.AwpAllowEveryone` | `false` | Ignore player preference — everyone is eligible |
| `Allocation.AwpLowPlayersThreshold` | `4` | Team size at or below which low-population mode activates |
| `Allocation.AwpLowPlayersChance` | `50` | % chance of AWP spawning in low-population mode |

| `Allocation.AwpPriorityFlag` | `""` | Permission flag that grants AWP priority (empty = disabled) |
| `Allocation.AwpPriorityPct` | `0` | % chance each AWP slot picks a priority player first |

### Scout (SSG08) Allocation

Only on full-buy rounds. Players who receive an AWP are excluded.

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Allocation.Ssg08Enabled` | `true` | Enable SSG08 allocation |
| `Allocation.Ssg08PerTeam` | `0` | Maximum SSG08s given per team (0 = disabled) |
| `Allocation.Ssg08AllowEveryone` | `false` | Ignore player preference — everyone is eligible |

### Scout (SSG08) Half-Buy Allocation

Half-buy rounds only. Independent of the full-buy SSG08 preference — players toggle it separately in the `!retake` menu ("Play with SSG08 on half-buy"). Disabled by default; opt in by raising `Ssg08HalfPerTeam`.

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Allocation.Ssg08HalfEnabled` | `true` | Enable SSG08 allocation on half-buy rounds |
| `Allocation.Ssg08HalfPerTeam` | `0` | Maximum SSG08s given per team on half-buy (0 = disabled) |

> `!scout` / `!ssg` / `!ssg08` toggle the SSG08 preference for **both** full-buy and half-buy at once (single switch, mirrors `!awp`). Use the `!retake` menu for per-round-type control.

### Weapon Stripping

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Allocation.StripWeapons` | `true` | Remove existing weapons before giving new loadout |
| `Allocation.StripRemove` | `true` | Remove weapons instead of dropping them (keeps the ground clean) |
| `Allocation.GivePistolOnRifleRounds` | `true` | Give secondary pistol on half/full-buy rounds |

---

## Grenade Allocation

Grenades are configured separately from primary weapons, with three distinct allocation modes.

### Allocation Modes

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Grenades.AllocationType` | `"random"` | `"random"`, `"fixed"`, or `"dynamic"` |

| Mode | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `"random"` | Each grenade in `RandomChances` is rolled independently per player with a configurable % chance |
| `"fixed"` | Every player on the team always receives exactly the grenades listed in `Fixed` |
| `"dynamic"` | A shared pool of grenades is distributed across the team, prioritising players who dealt the most damage last round |

### Per-Round Grenade Lists

Configured under `Grenades.Pistol`, `Grenades.HalfBuy`, and `Grenades.FullBuy`. Each has a `T` and `Ct` sub-object with three fields:

| Field | Used by mode | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `RandomChances` | `random` | Map of `"weapon_name": chance (0–100)`. Each entry rolled independently per player |
| `Fixed` | `fixed` | List of grenades every player on the team receives |
| `DynamicPool` | `dynamic` | Ordered shared pool distributed across eligible players. Duplicates = multiple of that type in the pool |

<details>
<summary><b>Example grenade config</b></summary>

```json
"Grenades": {
  "AllocationType": "dynamic",
  "FullBuy": {
    "T": {
      "RandomChances": { "weapon_smokegrenade": 100, "weapon_flashbang": 70, "weapon_molotov": 45 },
      "Fixed": [ "weapon_smokegrenade", "weapon_flashbang", "weapon_molotov" ],
      "DynamicPool": [ "weapon_smokegrenade", "weapon_flashbang", "weapon_flashbang", "weapon_hegrenade", "weapon_molotov" ]
    },
    "Ct": {
      "RandomChances": { "weapon_smokegrenade": 100, "weapon_flashbang": 70, "weapon_incgrenade": 45 },
      "Fixed": [ "weapon_smokegrenade", "weapon_flashbang", "weapon_incgrenade" ],
      "DynamicPool": [ "weapon_smokegrenade", "weapon_flashbang", "weapon_flashbang", "weapon_hegrenade", "weapon_incgrenade" ]
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

### Dynamic Mode Settings

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Grenades.DynamicMinDamage` | `1` | Minimum damage dealt last round for a player to be eligible |
| `Grenades.DynamicTopFraction` | `0.5` | Fraction (0.0–1.0) of eligible players who can receive grenades. Applied after sorting by damage, rounded up. `1.0` = all eligible |
| `Grenades.DynamicMaxPerPlayer` | `0` | Maximum total grenades one player can receive. `0` = no limit |
| `Grenades.DynamicUseCumulativeScore` | `false` | Use exponentially-weighted multi-round damage score for priority instead of raw last-round damage. The `DynamicMinDamage` threshold still uses last-round damage |

**How `DynamicTopFraction` works:**

| Eligible players | TopFraction | Players who receive grenades |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 5 | 0.5 | 3 (top 3 by damage) |
| 4 | 0.5 | 2 |
| 1 | 0.5 | 1 (always at least 1) |

The `DynamicPool` is distributed round-robin starting from the highest-damage player. If a player reaches `DynamicMaxPerPlayer`, they are skipped and the grenade moves to the next eligible player.

### Per-Grenade Cap

Applies across **all** allocation modes.

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Grenades.MaxPerGrenade` | See below | Maximum of each grenade type one player can receive |

Default caps (reflecting CS2 inventory limits):

```json
"MaxPerGrenade": {
  "weapon_flashbang":   2,
  "weapon_smokegrenade": 1,
  "weapon_hegrenade":   1,
  "weapon_molotov":     1,
  "weapon_incgrenade":  1,
  "weapon_decoy":       1
}
```

Grenades not listed here are uncapped.
